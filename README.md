# easy-log-calc
This is an old Android app I made back in 2013.

It's still published, available here (rated 3.8/5 stars): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meevasoft.logcalc&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5tZWV2YXNvZnQubG9nY2FsYyJd

I wanted to learn how to make an Android app, so one summer, I made a logarithm calculator. Here's the source. Error checking isn't perfect, but I just wanted to see what I could do with Android :)
